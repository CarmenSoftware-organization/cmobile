# Spot Check Workflow Documentation

## Overview
The Spot Check module allows users to perform ad-hoc inventory checks to ensure compliance and accuracy. The workflow is designed for speed, flexibility, and auditability.

## Workflow Logic
- Users select a location and items for spot check.
- Items are checked and results are recorded (pass/fail/discrepancy).
- Discrepancies are flagged for review and follow-up.
- Submission is allowed only when all items are checked.

## User Interface Implementation
- **Quick Actions**: Mark all as pass/fail, reset selection.
- **Status Indicators**: Visual cues for pass, fail, and pending items.
- **Dynamic Submit Button**: Enabled only when all items are checked.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Optimized for quick entry and review.

## Business Rules
- All selected items must be checked.
- Discrepancies require supervisor review.
- Only authorized users can submit spot checks.

## Technical Implementation
- State management for item check statuses and quick actions.
- Validation logic for completion and discrepancy handling.
- Workflow logic in the Spot Check session pages.

## Testing Scenarios
- Mark all as pass and verify status.
- Mark some as fail and check for discrepancy flag.
- Attempt to submit with unchecked items (should block).

## Compliance & Audit
- All spot check actions are logged.
- Supervisor approval required for discrepancies.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with audit and compliance systems.
- Support for photo attachments as evidence.
- Real-time notifications for failed checks.
