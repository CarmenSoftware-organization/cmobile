# Receiving Workflow Documentation

## Overview
The Receiving module manages the process of receiving goods against purchase orders (POs), including verification, discrepancy handling, and confirmation. The workflow is optimized for accuracy, efficiency, and compliance.

## Workflow Logic
- Users scan or select a PO to begin receiving.
- Each item is verified for quantity, quality, and condition.
- Discrepancies (short/over/defective) are flagged and require resolution.
- Confirmation page summarizes received items and status.

## User Interface Implementation
- **PO Scan/Selection**: Users can scan a PO code or select from a list.
- **Item Verification**: UI for entering received quantity, marking discrepancies, and adding comments.
- **Confirmation Page**: Summarizes all received items, highlights discrepancies, and provides final confirmation action.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: All controls are optimized for mobile use.

## Business Rules
- Only items on the PO can be received.
- Received quantity must not exceed ordered quantity unless over-receipt is allowed.
- Discrepancies must be resolved before final confirmation.

## Technical Implementation
- State management for PO selection, item verification, and discrepancy tracking.
- Workflow logic in the Receiving pages and supporting utilities.
- Integration with mock PO data for testing.

## Testing Scenarios
- Scan a PO and verify correct data is loaded.
- Enter received quantities and flag discrepancies.
- Attempt to confirm with unresolved discrepancies (should block).

## Compliance & Audit
- All receiving actions are logged.
- Only authorized users can confirm receipt.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with supplier and inventory systems.
- Support for photo attachments as evidence.
- Real-time notifications for discrepancies.
