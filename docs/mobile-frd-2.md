## Functional Requirements by Module

### Multi-Tenant Auth & Session

#### Login & Authentication
- Support for email/password, SSO, or token (configurable by deployment)
- Error messaging for invalid credentials, account lockout, and session expiry
- **Security Architecture**: AES-256 encryption for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- **Session Management**: JWT tokens with 8-hour expiry, automatic refresh
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions with Business Unit scope enforcement

#### Business Unit Definition
- A Business Unit (BU) represents a distinct hotel property within the Carmen Supply Chain system
- Examples include "Grand Hotel Singapore", "Business Hotel Jakarta", and "Boutique Hotel Bangkok"
- Business Units are the primary organizational entities for authorization, data segregation, and reporting
- Users are assigned to one or more Business Units based on their role and responsibilities
- **Currency Grouping**: Purchase Orders grouped by currency with exchange rate display for multi-currency operations

#### Session State & Audit
- All actions and scopes are bound to user authorization for one or more Business Units (BUs)
- Every login, logout, and security-relevant event is traced (user, time, method, outcome)
- **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: All transactions logged with user, timestamp, action, and business context

---

### Receiving Module (PO, GRN, Batch)

#### Receiving Navigation Flow

**Entry Point**
- Users access the Receiving module through the "Good Receive Note" card on the dashboard
- Direct access to GRN management is intentionally removed to enforce the proper receiving workflow

**Routing Flow**
1. **Dashboard → Good Receive Note**: Users first see the batch receiving/PO list screen
2. **PO Selection**: Users select one or more POs to process via traditional or scan workflow
3. **Business Unit Selection**: When creating GRNs, users select from their assigned hotel properties only
4. **Location Selection**: Users select specific store locations for receiving (with location-based item filtering)
5. **GRN Creation**: System creates GRN(s) based on selected PO(s) and locations
6. **GRN Detail**: Users are directed to the streamlined GRN detail page for item receiving
7. **Item Processing**: Users verify and update received quantities with enhanced unit selection
8. **GRN Completion**: Users finalize the GRN with appropriate status

**Navigation Restrictions**
- Users cannot directly access GRNs without going through the PO selection process
- This enforces data integrity by ensuring all GRNs are properly linked to source POs
- The "Add Item" functionality is intentionally removed to maintain traceability to source documents

#### Scan PO Workflow (Critical Feature)

**Smart QR/Barcode Scanning Implementation**
- **Three-Tier Detection Approach**:
  1. **Complete Context**: QR code contains full PO data, BU, and vendor information
  2. **Partial Context**: Barcode contains PO number only, requires BU selection
  3. **No Match**: Invalid or unrecognized codes, provides manual entry option

**Context-Aware Routing Logic**
- **Complete Context Flow**:
  - Scan QR → Auto-detect BU and vendor → Navigate directly to location selection
  - Performance target: ~30 seconds end-to-end
  - No manual data entry required

- **Partial Context Flow**:
  - Scan barcode → Extract PO number → Present BU selection → Navigate to location selection
  - Performance target: ~60 seconds end-to-end
  - Minimal manual input required

- **No Match Flow**:
  - Invalid scan → Present manual PO entry → Validate against system → Continue to location selection
  - Fallback to traditional workflow

**Smart Detection Features**
- **Automatic BU Detection**: When QR contains complete context, automatically route to correct business unit
- **Vendor Validation**: Cross-reference scanned data with system records for accuracy
- **Error Handling**: Clear feedback for invalid codes with suggested next steps
- **Scan History**: Track successful scans for audit and performance optimization

**Technical Implementation**
- **Camera Integration**: Native camera access with auto-focus and flash control
- **Code Recognition**: Support for QR codes, Code 128, Code 39, and EAN/UPC formats
- **Data Parsing**: Intelligent parsing of embedded PO data with validation
- **Offline Capability**: Cache recent PO data for offline scan validation

#### Enhanced Unit Selection (Critical Feature)

**Dual Unit Dropdown Implementation**
- **Separate Unit Selectors**: Each item provides independent unit dropdowns for:
  - "Received Qty" input field
  - "FOC Qty" (Free of Charge) input field
- **Flexible Receiving Scenarios**: Support different units for received vs. FOC quantities
- **Real-time Conversion**: Display conversion factors and totals as units are selected

**GrnItem Interface Enhancement**
```typescript
interface GrnItem {
  // ... existing fields ...
  receivedUnit: string;  // Unit for received quantity
  focUnit: string;       // Unit for FOC quantity
  receivedQty: number;
  focQty: number;
  // ... other fields ...
}
```

**Unit Selection Logic**
- **Available Units**: Display both PO units and inventory units for each item
- **Conversion Display**: Show conversion factors (e.g., "1 case = 12 bottles")
- **Validation**: Prevent invalid unit combinations and quantities
- **Default Behavior**: Pre-select PO unit as default, allow user override

#### Location-Based Item Organization (Critical Feature)

**Smart Item Filtering**
- **Automatic Filtering**: Items filtered by `itemDetail.storeLocation` matching selected locations
- **Location Grouping**: Items visually organized with location headers and item counts
- **Relevant Display**: Users only see items assigned to their selected receiving locations

**Location Selection Logic**
- **All Locations**: Show all items when "All locations" is selected
- **No Selection**: Display all items when no specific locations are chosen
- **Specific Locations**: Filter items to only those assigned to selected locations
- **Visual Organization**: Clear location headers with item counts for workflow efficiency

**Implementation Requirements**
- **Filter Method**: `items.filter(item => selectedLocations.includes(item.itemDetail.storeLocation))`
- **Fallback Handling**: Proper handling of items without assigned locations
- **Consistency**: Apply same filtering logic across all receiving flows (traditional and scan)

#### Streamlined GRN Interface (Critical Feature)

**Tab Structure Simplification**
- **Items Tab**: Core receiving functionality with enhanced unit selection
- **Summary Tab**: Financial totals, tax calculations, and approval workflow
- **Comments Tab**: Renamed from "Attachments" with chat-style interface

**Removed Functionality**
- **Signature Tab**: Explicitly removed from interface
- **Extra Cost Tab**: Explicitly removed from interface
- **Signature Capture**: No longer required in mobile workflow
- **Extra Cost Entry**: Set to 0 in financial calculations

**Comments Interface Enhancement**
