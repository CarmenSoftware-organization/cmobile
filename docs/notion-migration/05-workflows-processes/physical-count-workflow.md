# Physical Count Workflow Documentation

## Overview
The Physical Count module enables users to perform inventory counts, reconcile discrepancies, and ensure stock accuracy. The workflow supports quick actions, bulk selection, and dynamic status indicators.

## Workflow Logic
- Users select a session and location to begin counting.
- Items can be counted individually or in bulk using quick actions.
- Discrepancies are flagged for review.
- Final submission is allowed only when all items are counted or marked as not found.

## User Interface Implementation
- **Bulk/Quick Actions**: Options to mark all as counted, not found, or reset.
- **Dynamic Submit Button**: Enabled only when all items are resolved.
- **Status Indicators**: Visual cues for counted, not found, and pending items.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Optimized for touch and small screens.

## Business Rules
- All items must be counted or explicitly marked as not found.
- Discrepancies require supervisor review before final submission.
- Only authorized users can submit counts.

## Technical Implementation
