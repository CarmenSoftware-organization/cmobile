### 2. Enhanced Scan PO Workflow

#### 2.1 Scan Interface
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [←] Scan PO                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤

#### 2.2 Smart PO Detection Logic

**Case A: PO Found with Business Unit**
```
Scan Result: PO-1001
├── PO Found: ✅
├── Business Unit: "Grand Hotel Singapore"
├── Vendor: "Aqua Supplier"
├── Currency: "USD"
└── Action: Direct to Location Selection
```

**Case B: PO Found without Business Unit**
```
Scan Result: PO-1003
├── PO Found: ✅
├── Business Unit: ❌ (Missing)
├── Vendor: "Coffee Traders"
└── Action: Redirect to BU Selection
```

**Case C: PO Not Found**
```
Scan Result: PO-9999
├── PO Found: ❌
├── Error: "PO not found"
└── Actions: [Scan Again] [Manual Entry]
```

#### 2.3 Streamlined Path (PO with BU)

```
Scan PO → PO Found (with BU) → Select Location → GRN Detail → Complete
   ↓           ↓                    ↓              ↓           ↓
📱 Scan    ✅ Context         📍 Location    📝 Items    ✅ Submit
2 sec      Instant           1 tap          Review      1 tap
```

**Total Steps**: 4 screens, ~30 seconds
**User Actions**: 4 taps

#### 2.4 Standard Path (PO without BU)

```
Scan PO → PO Found (no BU) → Select BU → Select POs → GRN Detail → Complete
   ↓           ↓                ↓          ↓           ↓           ↓
📱 Scan    ⚠️ Missing BU    🏢 Choose   📋 Select   📝 Items    ✅ Submit
2 sec      Redirect         1 tap       1+ taps     Review      1 tap
```

**Total Steps**: 6 screens, ~60 seconds
**User Actions**: 5+ taps

### 3. Location Selection Enhancement

#### 3.1 Context-Aware Location Selection
**Route**: `/receiving/select-location`
**Parameters**: `?po=PO-1001&bu=Grand+Hotel+Singapore&vendor=Aqua+Supplier&currency=USD`

**Features**:
- Pre-populated context information
- Location filtering based on BU
- Smart location suggestions based on PO type
- Direct navigation to GRN detail
