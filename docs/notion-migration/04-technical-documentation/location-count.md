## Financial Treatment by Inventory Method

### **Physical/Counted Inventory**
**Balance Sheet Impact:**
- Recorded as **Inventory Asset** at cost
- Increases assets when purchased
- Decreases assets when consumed/sold

**Income Statement:**
- Moves to **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** when used
- Timing: When physically counted out or consumed

**Journal Entries:**
```
Purchase: Dr. Inventory / Cr. Accounts Payable
Usage: Dr. COGS / Cr. Inventory
```

### **Issue Balance/Book Inventory**
**Balance Sheet:**
- Maintains **Inventory Asset** based on calculated amounts
- Adjusted periodically when physical counts reveal variances

**Income Statement:**
- **COGS** recorded based on requisitions/issues
- **Inventory Adjustments** for shrinkage/variances

**Journal Entries:**
```
Issue: Dr. COGS / Cr. Inventory
Variance: Dr. Inventory Adjustment Expense / Cr. Inventory
```

### **Direct Location Inventory**
**Balance Sheet:**
- **No inventory asset** recorded
- Bypasses balance sheet entirely

**Income Statement:**
- **Immediate expense** when delivered
- Goes directly to departmental operating expenses

**Journal Entries:**
```
Delivery: Dr. Department Expense / Cr. Accounts Payable
(No inventory asset created)
```

### **Consignment Inventory**
**Balance Sheet:**
- **Not recorded as asset** (vendor owns until used)
- No accounts payable until consumption

**Income Statement:**
- **COGS/Expense** only when actually consumed
- Payment terms often net 30-60 days after usage

**Journal Entries:**
```
Receipt: No entry (memo record only)
Usage: Dr. COGS/Expense / Cr. Accounts Payable
Payment: Dr. Accounts Payable / Cr. Cash
```

## Financial Management Implications

### **Cash Flow Impact**
- **Traditional inventory:** Cash outflow at purchase, consumption later
- **Direct location:** Immediate cash outflow and expense recognition
- **Consignment:** Cash outflow delayed until after consumption

### **Working Capital Effects**
- **Counted inventory:** Ties up working capital in assets
- **Direct location:** Improves cash flow, reduces inventory carrying costs
- **Consignment:** Best cash flow (vendor financing), but may have higher unit costs

### **Financial Reporting Considerations**
- **Inventory turnover ratios** affected by method choice
- **Gross margin calculations** vary by timing recognition
- **Variance analysis** more complex with mixed methods
- **Month-end closing** procedures differ significantly

### **Cost Control Integration**
The hospitality industry often uses multiple methods simultaneously, requiring:
- Separate cost centers for tracking
- Different approval workflows
- Varied reporting frequencies
- Integrated variance analysis across all methods

This creates a complex but flexible financial framework that matches the operational realities of hospitality businesses.
