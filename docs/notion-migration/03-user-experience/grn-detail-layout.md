# GRN Detail Page â€” Screen Layout Description

## Architecture Changes

**Note**: The separate PO Detail view (`/receiving/[poId]`) has been removed from the application. The main functionality of that view (Resume Draft GRN) has been consolidated into the Pending POs list header for better user experience and reduced navigation complexity.

### Business Unit Selection Bypass

**New Feature**: When creating a new GRN from the Pending POs page:
- **Condition**: A specific Business Unit must be selected (not "All")
- **Flow**: New GRN button routes directly to `/receiving/new` bypassing `/receiving/select-bu`
- **Implementation**: 
  - Selected BU is stored in sessionStorage
  - BU passed as URL parameter: `bu=SelectedBusinessUnit`
  - New GRN page automatically recognizes and uses the pre-selected BU
- **Benefits**: 
  - Eliminates redundant BU selection step
  - Maintains context from filter selection
  - Streamlined user experience with one less screen

### Resume Draft GRN Functionality
- **Location**: Now displayed as a banner in the Pending POs list header (`/receiving/pending-pos`)
- **Trigger**: Shows when any draft GRNs exist in the system
- **Content**: Lists all draft GRNs with their linked PO numbers, creation dates, and resume buttons
- **Benefits**: 
  - Eliminates unnecessary navigation steps
  - Provides immediate visibility of draft work
  - Maintains context within the PO workflow
